This guide will get you up and running with AGIT in just a few minutes.

## How AGIT Works with Git

AGIT is designed as a **transparent wrapper** around Git, following the principle of least surprise. You can continue using standard Git commands (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) exactly as before—AGIT hooks into Git's event system to capture context automatically.

This approach follows industry best practices for developer tooling:
- **Non-intrusive integration**: AGIT doesn't replace Git; it extends it
- **Zero workflow disruption**: Your existing CI/CD pipelines, Git aliases, and muscle memory remain intact
- **Graceful degradation**: If AGIT is unavailable, Git operations proceed normally

When you run `git commit`, AGIT's post-commit hook automatically creates a corresponding neural commit, linking your reasoning to the code changes. You can also use `agit commit` for explicit control over both operations.

## Initialize AGIT

Navigate to your Git repository and initialize AGIT:

```bash
cd your-project
agit init
```

This creates:
- `.agit/` - Neural graph storage directory
- `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions for Claude Code
- `.cursorrules` - Instructions for Cursor
- `.windsurfrules` - Instructions for Windsurf

:::caution Important: Restart Required
After running `agit init`, **restart your AI editor** (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.) to activate AGIT memory logging.

## Record Your First Thought

Manually record a thought to the staging area:

```bash
agit record "Planning to add user authentication"
```

:::info Automatic Recording with AI Editors
In practice, you won't need to run `agit record` manually. When using AI-assisted editors like **Cursor** or **Claude Code**, your AI assistant automatically logs intents and reasoning through the MCP integration. The manual command is primarily useful for recording your own thoughts or when working without an AI editor.

## Check Status

See what's in your staging area:

```bash
agit status
```

Output:
```
AGIT Status
Branch: main

Staging area:
  1 entries pending

Recent entries:
  [10:42:15] user/intent: Planning to add user authentication
```

## Create a Commit

After making your code changes, stage and commit with AGIT:

```bash
# Stage your changes and freeze context
agit add .

# Create both git commit and neural commit in one command
agit commit -m "Add user authentication"
```

Output:
```
Created git commit:    e8d4f1a
Created neural commit: a3f7b2c

Summary: Intent: Planning to add user authentication.
```

## View History

See your commit history with context:

```bash
agit log
```

Output:
```
commit a3f7b2c (HEAD -> main)
Git:    e8d4f1a
Date:   2024-01-15 10:45:32

    Add user authentication

    Summary: Intent: Planning to add user authentication.
```

## View Full Context

See the complete reasoning trace for a commit:

```bash
agit show a3f7b2c
```

This shows:
- The commit summary
- Linked git commit
- Full trace of user intents and AI reasoning

## Using with AI Editors

The real power of AGIT comes from automatic logging. When using an AI editor like Cursor or Claude Code:

1. **Your AI assistant reads** the generated rules files
2. **While working**, it automatically logs thoughts via MCP
3. **When you commit**, AGIT synthesizes the reasoning

No manual `agit record` needed - everything happens automatically.
