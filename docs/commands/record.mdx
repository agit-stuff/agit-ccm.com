Manually record a thought to AGIT's staging area.

## Usage

```bash
agit record <message>
agit record --role <role> --category <category> <message>
```

## Description

Adds a thought entry to the staging area (`.agit/index`). These entries are included in the next neural commit.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `message` | The thought content to record |

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--role`, `-r` | `user` | Role: `user` or `ai` |
| `--category`, `-c` | `intent` | Category: `intent`, `reasoning`, etc. |

## Examples

### Record User Intent

```bash
agit record "Add dark mode to settings page"
```

This records with default role=user, category=intent.

### Record with Specific Role/Category

```bash
agit record --role ai --category reasoning "Will use CSS variables for theme switching"
```

### Record AI Decision

```bash
agit record -r ai -c decision "Using localStorage for theme persistence"
```

## Categories

Common categories:

| Category | Description | Typical Role |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `intent` | What the user wants | user |
| `reasoning` | How to approach it | ai |
| `decision` | Technical choice made | ai |
| `observation` | Something noticed | ai |

You can use custom categories - they're just strings.

## Output

```bash
$ agit record "Implement user search feature"
Recorded thought to staging area
```

## Storage Format

Entries are stored as JSONL in `.agit/index`:

```json
{"role":"user","category":"intent","content":"Implement user search","timestamp":"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"}
```

## When to Use

- **Manual workflow**: When not using an AI editor with MCP
- **Adding context**: When the AI didn't capture something important
- **Quick notes**: For developer thoughts during implementation

For AI editors with MCP (Cursor, Claude Code), recording happens automatically.
