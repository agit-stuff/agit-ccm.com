This guide will get you up and running with AGIT in just a few minutes.

## Initialize AGIT

Navigate to your Git repository and initialize AGIT:

```bash
cd your-project
agit init
```

This creates:
- `.agit/` - Neural graph storage directory
- `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions for Claude Code
- `.cursorrules` - Instructions for Cursor
- `.windsurfrules` - Instructions for Windsurf

## Record Your First Thought

Manually record a thought to the staging area:

```bash
agit record "Planning to add user authentication"
```

## Check Status

See what's in your staging area:

```bash
agit status
```

Output:
```
AGIT Status
Branch: main

Staging area:
  1 entries pending

Recent entries:
  [10:42:15] user/intent: Planning to add user authentication
```

## Create a Commit

After making your code changes, stage and commit with AGIT:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Create both git commit and neural commit in one command
agit commit -m "Add user authentication"
```

Output:
```
Created git commit:    e8d4f1a
Created neural commit: a3f7b2c

Summary: Intent: Planning to add user authentication.
```

## View History

See your commit history with context:

```bash
agit log
```

Output:
```
commit a3f7b2c (HEAD -> main)
Git:    e8d4f1a
Date:   2024-01-15 10:45:32

    Add user authentication

    Summary: Intent: Planning to add user authentication.
```

## View Full Context

See the complete reasoning trace for a commit:

```bash
agit show a3f7b2c
```

This shows:
- The commit summary
- Linked git commit
- Full trace of user intents and AI reasoning

## Using with AI Editors

The real power of AGIT comes from automatic logging. When using an AI editor like Cursor or Claude Code:

1. **Your AI assistant reads** the generated rules files
2. **While working**, it automatically logs thoughts via MCP
3. **When you commit**, AGIT synthesizes the reasoning

No manual `agit record` needed - everything happens automatically.
